Data Structures to Add
    - Stream to abstract over files and
    character streams
    - Finite State Machines?
    - Regex?
    - Threading model? - Simple wrapper around pthreads?
    - Event Loop? - Event handlers with an emit_event, and event generators?

Philosophy: Don't add an item until it has
been used in a project, and has proven useful
in that project
